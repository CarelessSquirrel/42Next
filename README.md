This repository is, or will be an archive of my time at 42.
As of 8/12/2025(8 Dec. 2025) the curriculum has been changed to "42Next".
So all of the cohorts that started in October of 2025, or more specifically 6/10/2025(6 Oct. 2025) Will be the first to try the new 42Next curriculum, including me.
Therefore will this repository not contain any of the Systems engineering and C/C++ projects you would usually see in pre-42Next 42 GitHub repositories.
And rather will be one of the first few repositories of the new core curriculum which will include mostly Python from Milestone 1 and onward.
As of now: 12/12/2025 3:54AM this repository is not public, however i am planning on publicizing this repository later on, when i have finished my time at 42.
I hope this repository and it's contents can serve as an insight and/or blueprint to the new cohorts that will be doing the 42Next curriculum.
Later on this repository might also, on the side, serve as a "blog" where i give my feedback on the new core. 
I will do this because i can still discuss the old curriculum with the students from earlier cohorts at my school, before all of the pre-42Next students have graduated.
